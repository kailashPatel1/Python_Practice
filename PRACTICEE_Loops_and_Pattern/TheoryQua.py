#  THEORY INTERVIEW QUESTIONS #

# FUNCTION and how they help in code optimizations

    # Function is a block of code that can be called by other part of program.
    # function allow you to reuse code by encapsulating it in a single place
    # and calling it multiple times from different parts of your program

# Module:-

# A module in python is simply a.py file containig python code.
# this code can be imported and used in onother python script using the import statement.

# Package:-
    # package is a collection of modules. it is a way of organizating
    #   related python modules into directory.


# Indexing:
    #  a way of access individual elements or groups of elements in an
    #   iterables by their position, indexing start from .


# Logical oparators:-
            # logical operators and,or,not, can be used to perform boolean
            #    operations on truth values(True and False).


# Lamda Expresssion:-
        # The lamda is used to define a function without a name in python.
        # they are useful in situations whare you need a small,
        #temporary function that you won't need to use elsewhare in your code.


# Slicing:-
    #    slicing in python is a feature that allows you to access a subsets os
    #  a 'slice' of list.



# Generators:-
            # A generators in python returns an iterator that produces
    #   sequences of values one at atime.we use yield to produce values.


# Shallow Copy and deep Copy:-

# in python ,deep and shallow copy are used to copy objects.

# Shallow Copy:is a copy of an object that stores the reference of the original elements.
# Deep Copy:is a process whare we create a new object and add copy elements recursively.

# Exception Handling:-
#   it involes using special block of code.
#   so that it can catch and handle errors or exceptions that occure at run time of codes.
# the main keywords for exception handling in python are try, except,finaly and raise.


# Decorators:-
# in python decoders are a special kind of function that add extra functionality to onother function.
# they do this without changing the other functions code.
