#3. How do you count the occurrence of an element in a tuple?

# tup=(2,4,2,3,5,4,1,5,4)
# element=4
# count = 0
# for i in tup:
#     if i == element:
#         count += 1
# print(count)



## Method second:

# tup = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5)
# element = 2
# count=tup.count(element)
# print(count)




t=(3,5,7,3,6,4,1,3)
item=3
count=t.count(item)
print(count)
